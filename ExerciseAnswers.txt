Excercise 1
	3. The function "About()" in the HomeController class got executed.
	5. The MVC framework first uses the "home" portion of the URL, which
	   indicates that it should use the HomeController class. It then
	   uses the "about" portion, which indicates that it should call the
	   About() function of the HomeController class. Once that function
	   is called and returns the result of View(), it renders the view
	   located under "~Views/Home/About".
Exercise 2
	1. The About() function.
	2. The controller sets the content in ViewBag.Message.
	3. The view is located in Views/Home/About.cshtml
	4. The folder hierarchy convention is Views/{ControllerName}/{ActionName}.
	5. The data generated by the controller is located in the <h3> tags,
	   below the the larger "About." heading and above the short paragraph.
Exercise 3

	8. I now see the same page with the person data I added.
